# Business_Analytics_CP

## Description
This project is a comprehensive analytics platform designed to process and visualize football league data. It integrates a Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and a Python script for deploying an interactive web application.

### Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Clean and process football match results and league data.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides rich visualizations for trends and performance.
- **Web Application**: A Streamlit-based web app for interactive user experiences.

## Files
- **Data Folder**: This folder contains scripts for data preprocessing, gathering, and web scraping to obtain the relevant data for our model.
- **Model Folder**: This folder includes the exploratory analysis and the scripts used to train the model based on the collected data.
- **Website Folder**: This folder holds the code for the final website, which integrates the model with user inputs to predict stadium attendance. It serves as the final interface and the culmination of our work. The Python script in this folder powers an interactive web application, accessible at: https://businessanalytics-c5bqundnhifhyhmzobdngc.streamlit.app.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required for this project:
- base64
- datetime
- io
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- pickle
- requests
- streamlit

Install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Web Application
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the script using Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_v4_final.py
   ```
3. Or just open https://businessanalytics-c5bqundnhifhyhmzobdngc.streamlit.app

### Using the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the notebook file "main.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute cells interactively to explore data.

## Dataset Details
The project uses football match results and league data, which are processed and analyzed within the notebook and the web app.

### CSV Files
- `football_results.csv`: Contains historical match results.
- `new_league_data.csv`: Includes additional league data displayed interactively on the website. Contains example data just to demonstrate the layout and the functionality of the website.
- `SwissGDP.csv`: Contains GDP data for Switzerland.
- `SwissHoliday.csv`: Includes a list of Swiss public holidays.
- `transfermarkt_data_with_competitions_and_weather_complete.csv`: Comprehensive dataset combining football competition data with weather conditions for enhanced match analysis.

### IPYNB Files
- `Web_Scraping.ipynb`: Scrapes data from websites for further use.
- `Data_Cleaning.ipynb`: Cleans and preprocesses raw data for analysis.
- `Group_project.ipynb`: Explores the data and trains models as the main part of the group project.

### PY Files
- `app_v4_final.py`: Implements the final version of the website application.
